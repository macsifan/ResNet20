# Res_NET20

Train ResNet20 on CIFAR10, implement the quantization method and get its results.

Implement the ResNet20 architecture.

Train ResNet20 (the accuracy of the network must be at least 90%)

Use Pytorch Quantization

Quantize to 16 and 8 bits

Implement PTQ from scratch

Comparison of results.
